    $superTrouper = "Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
        But I won't feel blue
        Like I always do
        'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
        I was sick and tired of everything
        When I called you last night from Glasgow
        All I do is eat and sleep and sing
        Wishing every show was the last show (wishing every show was the last show)
        So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you're coming)
        Suddenly I feel all right
        (And suddenly it's gonna be)
        And it's gonna be so different
        When I'm on the stage tonight
        Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
        Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Feeling like a number one
        Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
        But I won't feel blue (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Like I always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
        Facing twenty thousand of your friends
        How can anyone be so lonely
        Part of a success that never ends
        Still I'm thinking about you only (still I'm thinking about you only)
        There are moments when I think I'm going crazy (think I'm going crazy)
        But it's gonna be alright 
        (You'll soon be changing everything)
        Everything will be so different
        When I'm on the stage tonight
        Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
        Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Feeling like a number one
        Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
        But I won't feel blue (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Like I always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
        So I'll be there when you arrive
        The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
        And when you take me in your arms
        And hold me tight
        I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
        Tonight the super trouper lights are gonna find me
        Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Feeling like a number one
        Tonight the super trouper beams are gonna blind me
        But I won't feel blue (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Like I always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
        lights are gonna find me
        Shining like the sun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Smiling, having fun (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Feeling like a number one
        beams are gonna blind me
        But I won't feel blue (sup-p-per troup-p-per)
        Like I always do (sup-p-per troup-p-per)";

    $mammaMia = "I been cheated by you since you know when
        So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
        Look at me now, will I ever learn?
        I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
        There's a fire within my soul
        Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
        One more look and I forget everything
        Mamma mia, here I go again
        My my, how can I resist you?
        Mamma mia, does it show again
        My my, just how much I've missed you?
        Yes, I've been brokenhearted
        Blue since the day we parted
        Why, why did I ever let you go?
        Mamma mia, now I really know
        My my, I could never let you go
        I've been angry and sad about things that you do
        I can't count all the times that I've told you \"we're through\"
        And when you go, when you slam the door
        I think you know that you won\'t be away too long
        You know…";

    $fernando = "Can you hear the drums Fernando
        I remember long ago another starry night like this
        In the firelight Fernando
        You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
        I could hear the distant drums
        And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
        They were closer now Fernando
        Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
        I was so afraid Fernando
        We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
        And I'm not ashamed to say
        The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
        There was something in the air that night
        The stars were bright, Fernando
        They were shining there for you and me
        For liberty, Fernando
        Though I never thought that we could lose
        There's no regret
        If I had to do the same again
        I would, my friend, Fernando
        If I…";

        Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
        I've heard about him before
        I wanted to know some more
        And now I know what they mean, he's a love machine
        Oh, he makes me dizzy
        Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey
        Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey
        The way that you kiss good night
        The way that you hold me tight
        I feel like I wanna sing
        When you do your thing
        Honey…";

        You're enchained by your own sorrow
        In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
        How I hate to see you like this
        There is no way you can deny it
        I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet
        Chiquitita, tell me the truth
        I'm a shoulder you can cry on
        Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
        You were always sure of yourself
        Now I see you've broken a feather
        I hope we can patch it up together
        Chiquitita, you and I know
        How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
        You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
        You will have no time for grieving
        Chiquitita, you and I cry
        But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
        Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
        Sing a new song, Chiquitita
        Try once more like you did before
        Sing a new song, Chiquitita
        So the walls came tumbling down
        And your love's a blown out candle
        All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
        Chiquitita, tell me the truth
        There is no way you can deny it
        I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet
        Chiquitita, you and I know
        How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
        You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
        You will have no time for grieving

        Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
        Sing a new song, Chiquitita
        Try once more like you did before

        You can jive

        Ooh, see that girl
        Watch that scene
        Dig in the dancing queen
        Friday night and the lights are low
        Looking out for a place to go
        Where they play the right music
        Getting in the swing
        You come to look for a king
        Anybody could be that guy
        Night is young and the music's high
        With a bit of rock music
        Everything is fine
        You're in the mood for a dance
        And when you get the chance
        You are the dancing queen
        Young and sweet
        Only seventeen
        Dancing queen
        Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
        You can dance
        You can jive
        Having the time of your life
        Ooh, see that girl
        Watch that scene
        Dig in the dancing queen
        You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
        Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
